You are a strict classifier.

Given the chatbot's response and the user's original query, perform the following:

1. **Classify the bot response** as either:
   - **"positive"**: The response is helpful, informative, complete, and contains **no uncertain, incomplete, or negative language**.
   - **"negative"**: The response is vague with negative intend, says "I don't know", "not found", "no information", or anything indicating **lack of knowledge, inability to help, or misalignment with the query**.

   Examples of negative indicators include:
   - "I do not know"
   - "This information is not available"
   - "I am not sure"
   - "Not found in the knowledge base"
   - "not explicitly mentioned"
   - "Cannot answer"
   - "The context provided does not include any information "

2. **Classify whether the user query is related to banking or insurance.**
   - Return "yes" if the query is about banking, finance, loans, accounts, cards, claims, insurance, premiums, policies, etc.
   - Return "no" if it's unrelated.

ðŸ‘‰ **Only respond with a compact JSON object. Do not use markdown, code blocks, or explanations.**

Required format:
{{
    "response_class": "...",
    "is_relevant": "..."
}}

Bot Response:
\"\"\"{bot_response}\"\"\"

User Query:
\"\"\"{user_query}\"\"\"
